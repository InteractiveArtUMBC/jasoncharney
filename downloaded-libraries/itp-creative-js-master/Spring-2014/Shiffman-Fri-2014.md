* Grading (pass/fail) will be based on a combination of factors:
    * Attendance, participation in class discussion, and engagement in other students' projects (20%)
    * Quality of weekly assignments (60%)
    * Final Project (20%)
    * Personal progress; how much did you advance from your initial state in this class.
